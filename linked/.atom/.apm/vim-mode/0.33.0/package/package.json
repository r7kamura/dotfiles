Even so, this package is far from finished (Vim\nwasn't built in a day).\n\nCurrently, vim-mode requires soft line wraps to be disabled, and has some issues\nwith international keyboard layouts.\n\nIf there's a feature of Vim you're missing, it might just be that you use it\nmore often than other developers. Adding a feature can be quick and easy.

We're looking forward to yours, too.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Overview](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/master/docs/overview.md)\n* [Motions](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/master/docs/motions.md)\n* [Operators](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/master/docs/operators.md)\n* [Windows](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/master/docs/windows.md)\n* [Scrolling](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/master/docs/scrolling.md)\n\n### Development\n\n* Create a branch with your feature/fix.\n* Add a spec (take inspiration from the ones that are already there).\n* If you're adding a command be sure to update the appropriate file in\n  `docs/`\n* Create a PR.\n\nWhen in doubt, open a PR earlier rather than later so that you can receive\nfeedback from the community.
